const AnnieRohnan = `Annie: I mean they're more than douchebags if they straight up are racist
Rohnan: why would you be allowed to change your initial accusation?
Annie: Because I am human and humans make mistakes Rohnan
Annie: Would you like me to issue a worldwide apology
Rohnan: I would love that
Annie: Oh then I'm definitely not doing it sorry
Rohnan: I forgive you.
Annie: Your forgiveness is useless if it doesn't let me out of gitmo
Annie: So therefore I don't accept your forgiveness
Rohnan: then your need to earn my forgiveness will drive you to do better things sweet summer child
Annie: I think you calling me that just made me throw up in my mouth a bit
Josh: BABABOOEY

Another day:
Annie: Why are you in light mode
Rohnan: Because I’m afraid of change
Annie: Then use debit
Annie: I'm sorry that was terrible
Rohnan: Why would I use debit when I’m afraid of the inevitable march of time
Annie: Because time is money Rohnan
Rohnan: That’s why I last 30 seconds
Rohnan: It’s economical
Annie: Goddamn
Annie: Didn't think you'd just attack yourself like that
Annie: I have no comebacks

Another day:
Annie: Wait can someone tell me if "going on a bender" is a thing you all know or it's rural
Rohnan: I don't think going on a bender is rural
Rohnan: it's just older slang
Annie: Okay well we still say it so
Rohnan: and I still say groovy
Annie: Okay but that makes you 45
Rohnan: that doesn't change the fact that it's older slang
Annie: No I'm saying that if people in my rural town still say it and no one else does even if it was an older term, it is now more of a rural thing
Rohnan: also groovy is older than 45
Annie: Yeah probably
Rohnan: "fuck yeah bud" isn't hick
Rohnan: it's hockey
Rohnan: I work with tons of hockey players and they say that constantly
Annie: Yeah but hockey lingo tends to easily go into rural areas
Annie: Like rural slang tends to be hockey slang
Rohnan: hockey slang still exists in the cities
Rohnan: therefore rural slang is city slang
Annie: I can guarantee you that the things you hear in rural towns are much different than in the city
Annie: City people speak differently
Rohnan: you just said rural slang is hockey slang
Rohnan: hockey slang is in the cities too
Rohnan: so city people do not speak differently
Annie: It may exist in the city, but that doesn't mean it's used in the city often enough to be apart of the culture
Rohnan: it is though
Rohnan: there are more hockey players in cities
Annie: But to you you consider that "hockey slang" and to us we just consider it normal
Annie: Because it's so common where I'm from
Annie: So in the city you've sectioned it off
Rohnan: it's common in the city too
